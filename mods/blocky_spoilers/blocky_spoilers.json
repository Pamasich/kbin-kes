This is different from the usual approach where the spoiler text is shown in full but obscured by a black bar until hovered over or clicked.\n\nThis addon changes spoilers to work like on other platforms, which you might be more familiar with.\n\nBy default you'll be able to toggle whether a spoiler is obscured by clicking on its header (the always visible text). Optionally, hovering is also supported to temporarily show a spoiler. But you'll still have to click to make it stick.",
