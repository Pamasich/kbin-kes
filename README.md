This is my personal fork of KES (Kbin Enhancement Suite) for development purposes.

Work is being done in individual `mod/{mod-name}` branches, which are kept open for future changes to the mod.
The `tests` branch exists for automated tests and my own adjusted KES userscript which I use to test my changes.

# Issues

All my ideas for kbin (not just KES) are organized as issues on a [kanban board](https://github.com/users/Pamasich/projects/2).

Each issue has a `priority` label (low, medium, high), representing how needed the feature is, and an `effort` label 
(low, moderate, high), indicating how much work I expect it to be.

Generally a bugfix has a priority of medium or higher, while changes in KES's code or a third party mod are given an 
effort level of "moderate" as the minimum. This is because I'll have to put in time to understand the existing code 
first.

Many issues are also given an additional label to indicate what type of work they are: a new `mod`, a `feature` for an
existing one, or a `bugfix`.
